        <h2>Ingredients</h2>   
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup Sooji (semolina/rava)</li>
            <li> 1/3 cup Ghee (clarified butter) (or 1/4 cup)</li>
            <li> 1¼ cups Water</li>
            <li> 1/2 cup Sugar</li>
            <li> 5 Almonds (badam), sliced</li>
            <li> 5 Cashew nuts (kaju), chopped</li>
            <li> 1/4 teaspoon Cardamom Powder</li>
        </ul>     

        <h2>Steps</h2>   
        <ol>
            <li>Pour 1¼ cups water in a small saucepan and bring it to boil over medium flame, it will take around 3-4 minutes. Remove it from the flame and keep aside until you reach step-4 below</li>
            <li> Take sooji in a heavy based pan, add ghee and heat it over medium flame.</li>
            <li>Stir and mix using spatula.</li>
            <li> Roast it until golden-brown. It will take anywhere between 8 to 10 minutes</li>
            <li>Reduce flame to low; slowly add boiled water and mix by stirring constantly (add water only in small incremental quantities because it will splutter as soon as you add it).</li>
            <li>Stir and cook to avoid any lump formation.</li>
            <li>Increase flame to medium and cook until all water gets absorbed. Add sugar and cardamom powder.</li>
            <li> Stir until sugar dissolves and it has a semi-solid consistency. Add and mix almonds and cashew nuts after reserving some of them for garnishing</li>
            <li>The suji halwa is now ready for serving.</li>
